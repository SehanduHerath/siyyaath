                If you’ve spent any amount of time online this past January you’re probably aware of the mass layoffs occurring across the tech and media industries.

There was the day Google laid off about 12,000 of its employees, leading early arrivals at the office to line up and see if their badge would turn green (job safe) or red (let go). Microsoft cut about 10,000 jobs. Amazon laid off over 18,000 people. Spotify, Intel, and IBM are among the other tech giants to announce layoffs recently.

The first month of the year has been just as bleak for the media industry. Vox Media and Dotdash Meredith (publisher of Verywell Mind, among other titles) each laid off 7% of their respective employees. NBC News and MSNBC laid off 75 employees. The Washington Post laid off 20 people and took down 30 job listings. 

Whether you’ve recently lost your job or are in an industry experiencing continual layoffs, this can undoubtedly hurt your mental health and can be especially hard when you're laid off remotely. The psychological impact should not be overlooked.
