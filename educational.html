                <a href="#" class="blog-title">Gun Violence and Mental Illness: Understanding Links and Misconceptions</a>
            <p>
                Whenever there’s a high-profile mass shooting, we'll often see politicians, people in the media, and people in our own lives making links between gun violence and mental illness.

This was the case earlier this month when a shooter killed ten people at a supermarket in Buffalo. And again, ten days later, after the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in which a shooter killed 19 students and two teachers. 

Eighteen-year-old Payton S. Gendron, accused of carrying out the Buffalo shooting, had been referred to a hospital for a mental health evaluation and counseling after telling a teacher that he “wanted to murder and commit suicide” in 2021. However, they released him after only a day and a half.

This information has once again ignited the conversation surrounding gun violence and mental illnesses like depression. As a result, there are a lot of misconceptions and falsehoods being spread.
It might be tempting to blame gun violence on mental illness. It’s a convenient scapegoat at a time when gun violence and mass shootings are real concerns. 

However, it doesn’t solve the problem, and can actually be harmful to those who do live with serious mental health conditions, in particular by adding to the stigma and potentially discouraging people from speaking up and getting help.

                <a href="#" class="blog-title">If You Were Laid Off Recently, Here's How to Cope</a>
            <p>
                If you’ve spent any amount of time online this past January you’re probably aware of the mass layoffs occurring across the tech and media industries.

There was the day Google laid off about 12,000 of its employees, leading early arrivals at the office to line up and see if their badge would turn green (job safe) or red (let go). Microsoft cut about 10,000 jobs. Amazon laid off over 18,000 people. Spotify, Intel, and IBM are among the other tech giants to announce layoffs recently.

The first month of the year has been just as bleak for the media industry. Vox Media and Dotdash Meredith (publisher of Verywell Mind, among other titles) each laid off 7% of their respective employees. NBC News and MSNBC laid off 75 employees. The Washington Post laid off 20 people and took down 30 job listings. 

Whether you’ve recently lost your job or are in an industry experiencing continual layoffs, this can undoubtedly hurt your mental health and can be especially hard when you're laid off remotely. The psychological impact should not be overlooked.

            <p>
                When the clock strikes midnight signaling the start of a new year, many adults will have committed themselves to a New Year’s resolution.

According to a Forbes Health/OnePoll survey conducted in October of 2023, 61.7% of respondents say they feel pressured to set a New Year’s resolution. In addition, many respondents are planning on setting multiple goals with 66.5% stating they plan on making three or more resolutions for the year ahead.1

Whether it’s to lose weight, get out of debt, pursue a coveted hobby, socialize more, or something else, for many, making New Year's resolutions is part of the festivities. And with so many people committing to goals for the new year, the hope and optimism that change can happen is in the air. The reality is, however, that over 90% of New Year’s resolutions will be abandoned within just a few months.2

Why aren’t we more successful at keeping our New Year’s resolutions? Some reasons include the idea that we're thinking too big, we're not considering the 'why' behind them, and the fact that we may not be ready for change.
