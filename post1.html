                Whenever there’s a high-profile mass shooting, we'll often see politicians, people in the media, and people in our own lives making links between gun violence and mental illness.

                This was the case earlier this month when a shooter killed ten people at a supermarket in Buffalo. And again, ten days later, after the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in which a shooter killed 19 students and two teachers. 
                
                Eighteen-year-old Payton S. Gendron, accused of carrying out the Buffalo shooting, had been referred to a hospital for a mental health evaluation and counseling after telling a teacher that he “wanted to murder and commit suicide” in 2021. However, they released him after only a day and a half.
                
                This information has once again ignited the conversation surrounding gun violence and mental illnesses like depression. As a result, there are a lot of misconceptions and falsehoods being spread.
                It might be tempting to blame gun violence on mental illness. It’s a convenient scapegoat at a time when gun violence and mass shootings are real concerns. 
                
                However, it doesn’t solve the problem, and can actually be harmful to those who do live with serious mental health conditions, in particular by adding to the stigma and potentially discouraging people from speaking up and getting help.
